    <h1>tables in html </h1>
    <p>defination: In HTML, a table is a structured way to organize data into rows and columns, creating a grid-like layout. Tables are used to present information in a tabular format, making it easier to understand and compare data. Each row in the table represents a set of related data, while each cell within the row represents an individual data point.

        To create a table in HTML, you use the following elements:
        
        'table': This is the container element for the entire table. It holds all the rows and cells.
        
        'tr': This element represents a table row. It is used to define a row of data in the table.
        
        'td': This element represents a table cell. It is used to define individual data cells within a row.</p>

                <th>name</th>
                <th>branch</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>harish</td>
              <td>cse</td>

              <td>prince</td>
              <td>cse</td>
