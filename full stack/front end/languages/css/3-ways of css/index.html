    <h1>CSS style</h1>
    <p>defination of style:  In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), "style" refers to the set of rules and properties that define how HTML elements are presented and displayed on a web page. It determines the visual appearance, layout, and design of the content within the HTML document.

        In CSS, you can define styles by selecting HTML elements or groups of elements and applying various properties to them. Each property has a corresponding value that specifies how that particular aspect of the element should be displayed. For example, you can define styles for elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, buttons, and more.</p>
