    <p>defination: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML and XML documents. CSS defines how the elements of a web page should be displayed on the screen, in print, or in other media. It allows web developers and designers to separate the content of a web page from its visual representation, promoting a more maintainable and organized codebase.

        With CSS, you can define styles such as colors, fonts, margins, padding, borders, and positioning of HTML elements, transforming a plain HTML document into a visually appealing and interactive website.</p>
