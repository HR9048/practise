  <h3>Hello, everyone!</h3>
  <h4>
    I am a passionate Web Developer with a solid background in PHP, WordPress, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With 9 months of hands-on experience, I have developed a keen eye for design and a strong understanding of both frontend and backend development. My focus has always been on creating visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly websites that deliver a seamless experience across all devices.
</h4>

<h4>
    Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects, including dynamic form interactions, session management, and integrating external libraries such as Select2 for enhanced functionality. These projects have allowed me to improve my skills in handling SQL queries, developing dynamic content, and working with modern web technologies to deliver efficient solutions.
</h4>

<h4>
    In my recent role as a PHP developer at KKRTC, I was responsible for designing and implementing solutions that ensured optimal performance for the transport corporation's digital systems. This included both frontend and backend tasks, where I integrated new features, improved existing code, and maintained website security. My work contributed to enhancing user experience and streamlining operations within the organization.
</h4>

<h4>
    I am also proficient in creating systems that involve live email notifications and data handling, as seen in a recent project where I integrated Google Mail to send automatic emails upon successful user registration. This project was a great opportunity to combine my backend coding skills with my understanding of user experience to create a smooth registration flow.
</h4>

<h4>
    My projects have often required me to collaborate with cross-functional teams, allowing me to refine my communication and teamwork skills. For instance, in a schedule management system project, I implemented features that allowed users to filter and manage schedules dynamically, making it easier for administrators to oversee operations. This experience has enhanced my ability to understand user requirements and deliver solutions that meet business objectives.
</h4>

<h4>
    Beyond my technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with industry trends. Whether itâ€™s exploring new libraries, learning about emerging technologies, or enhancing my design skills, I believe that continuous improvement is key to being an effective developer. I am always eager to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what I can do.
</h4>

<h4>
    I am excited to bring my skills, experience, and enthusiasm to a new role, where I can contribute to creating engaging digital experiences. I look forward to the opportunity to work in a dynamic environment that values innovation and collaboration, where I can grow and make a meaningful impact.
