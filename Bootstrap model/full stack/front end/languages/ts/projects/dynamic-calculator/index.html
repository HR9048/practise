    <h1>Dynamic Calculator</h1>
    <p>defination: A dynamic calculator is a software application that allows users to perform arithmetic calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in a flexible and interactive manner. Unlike a traditional physical calculator, a dynamic calculator is typically implemented as a digital tool within a computer program or a web application. It dynamically updates the display as users input numbers and operations, providing real-time feedback and results.

        <p>Key features of a dynamic calculator include:</p>
        
        <p>Interactive Interface: Dynamic calculators provide buttons for digits (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /), allowing users to easily input numbers and mathematical operations.</p>
        
        <p>Real-Time Calculation: As users input numbers and operators, the calculator instantly updates the displayed result or expression, helping users see the ongoing calculation process.</p>
        
        <p>Error Handling: Dynamic calculators usually have mechanisms to handle errors, such as division by zero or invalid mathematical expressions, by providing appropriate error messages or notifications.</p>
        
        <p>Clear and Reset: A "Clear" or "C" button is often included to erase the current calculation, allowing users to start over. This helps prevent errors and provides a convenient way to reset the calculator.</p>
        
        <p>Equals (=) Functionality: The "Equals" button calculates the result of the expression entered by the user and displays it on the screen.</p>
        
        <p>Styling and User Interface: Dynamic calculators often have user-friendly interfaces with visually appealing designs to make the calculation process more engaging and intuitive.</p>
        
        <p>Flexibility: Users can perform a series of calculations without needing to manually keep track of intermediate results. This is especially useful for complex calculations.</p>
